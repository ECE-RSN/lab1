Lab 1 (GPS) materials for EECE 5554

In Lab 1, you will learn to use a GPS puck and ROS to process and store data, analyze the GPS puck readout, and write a ROS publisher node. 
This lab is intended for maximum flexibility, and the contents of the repo are as is follows: 

- GPS instructions, a Jupyter notebook that describes the lab
- Python help, a Jupyter notebook that walks through the steps of the Python code (you can skip if you're comfortable writing in Python)
- ROS help, a Jupyter notebook that walks through the ROS publisher node steps (you can skip if you're comfortable writing ROS nodes in Python)
- ROSbags, a Jupyter notebook that contains resources for how to collect ROSbags
- SampleROSPublisher, a Jupyter notebook that walks through an example ROS publisher node

You may find the additional resources outside of this repo useful, including: 

- The SensorEmulator repo that has GPS info
- The Plot and Stats repo that has lots of Jupyter notebook examples on plotting, statistical, and other mathematical tools using SciPy

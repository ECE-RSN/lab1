    "\n",
    "- Understand what launch files do and why we use them\n",
    "- Write a Python-based launch file (ROS2 style)\n",
    "- Accept command-line arguments like <code>port:=/dev/ttyUSB0</code>\n",
    "- Add launch files to setup.py so ROS2 can find them\n",
    "\n",
    "It is OK if you have not written launch files before. ROS2 uses Python-based launch files (not XML like ROS1), so the syntax may be new even if you've used ROS1.\n",

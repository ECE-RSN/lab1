    "# EECE 5554 Lab 1: GNSS Drivers and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab 1 introduces several concepts that are critical to sensing and navigation in robotics. You will use a GNSS receiver to collect latitude and longitude data, convert latitude and longitude to UTM zone and letter, and publish this information in a custom ROS message. You will also analyze walking and stationary data that you collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, we expect that a well-prepared student will be able to: \n",
    "- Write a Python program to parse data read over USB serial \n",
    "- Convert latitude and longitude to UTM using the UTM package\n",
    "- Define a custom ROS message \n",
    "- Publish a custom message using a ROS publisher node\n",
    "- Save data using a .bag file \n",
    "\n",
    "## Information of Note\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware: \n",
    "- GPS puck (provided by course)\n",
    "- Laptop with sufficient battery life for at least two 10 minute data collections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software:\n",
    "- Working Ubuntu from Lab 0\n",
    "- Working ROS installation from Lab 0\n",
    "- A serial emulator called Minicom: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Minicom. Get it using <code> sudo apt install minicom </code>\n",
    "- Turbo87's package for converting between lat/long and UTM: https://github.com/Turbo87/utm . Get it using <code> pip3 install utm</code>\n",
    "- The course sensor emulator. Get it using <code> git clone https://github.com/ECE-RSN-Staff/sensor_emulator </code>\n",
    "- The course Lab 1 autograder and examples. Get them using <code> git clone https://github.com/ECE-RSN-Staff/lab_1 </code>\n",
    "- (Optional but recommended): A modern integrated development environment (IDE) like VS: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux\n",
    "\n",
    "### The GNSS driver:\n",
    "During this lab, you will write a driver that:\n",
    "- Reads the string the GNSS puck outputs from the serial port\n",
    "- Breaks this string into useful information (latitude, longitude, etc.)\n",
    "- Converts the string to specified ROS formats for lat, lon, UTM easting, and UTM northing\n",
    "- Merges the information into a custom message\n",
    "- Publishes the message\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individual and team work: \n",
    "Individual work: Write your own device driver for data acquisition and collect datasets. <br>\n",
    "Team work: Share the GPS based GNSS puck after you have tested with the emulator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sets: \n",
    "- One 5 minute .bag with stationary data in an open area (e.g., no trees or buildings within 10 m). Ideally, you will be close to some landmark where you can find the lat/long/alt coordinates.\n",
    "- One 5 minute .bag with stationary data in an occluded area (e.g., trees or buildings nearby). Ideally, you will be close to some landmark where you can find the lat/long/alt coordinates.\n",
    "- One .bag recording as you walk approximately 200 m in a straight line. Ideally, this dataset will include occluded and open areas, but anything is OK. Please make sure you make a note of this location and your start and end positions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repository structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to follow the naming convention laid out here to have an appropriate structure that can be checked by the Lab 1 autograder and to receive credit for your work. Please make sure you are following these conventions **exactly**-- spaces and capitalization matter!\n",
